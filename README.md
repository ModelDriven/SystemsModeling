All systems of interest to systems engineers are systems of systems. A challenge has been that components of these systems have been specified by different teams, with different perspectives, using different tools, based on different languages. Standards, such as SysML, have provided important leverage and have helped make some tools more interoperable, but flexible, cross-tool, and cross-domain integration is still a barrier to productivity and systems integrity.
SysML v2 offers a foundation for comprehensive systems design and integration based on principles of componentization, extensibility, and strong semantics. SysML v2 can provide the semantic glue between tools and perspectives that has been missing as well as substantial enhancements to the modeling language offered in SysML v1. SystemsModeling.com realizes this vision with open-source and commercial software, a vibrant community, supporting services, and a systems component library. The foundations of this capability are open standards and open source software combined with commercial services, training, and components to support demanding systems engineering projects.

SystemsModeling.com is the commercial open source hub for SysML V2
